# Node.js and Pair Programming

## Why this topic matters

    Node.js is important as it will allow us to use JavaScript for the complete full-stack experience (i.e. for both the front-end and back-end). 

    Pair programming is important as it allows us to expand our understanding of coding as we collaborate to efficiently write algorithms and become more job-ready.

## Node.js

Based on [An Introduction to Node.js](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/).

1. What is node.js?

    Quoting [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/node.js/info):

    > Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

    In simpler terms, node.js is software that allows us to run JavaScript locally and on servers.

2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

   Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine is what processes JavaScript into native code our computers can execute and is used in all Chromium-based websites.

3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

    A JavaScript runtime is any program that allows us to execute JavaScript on our computers.

4. What is npm?

    npm is a package manager for node. It is also a JavaScript software registry that allows us to install millions of different packages.

5. What version of node are you running on your machine?

    `v18.10.0`

6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

    `8.19.2`

7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

    `npm install jshint`

8. What is node used for?

    Node's biggest advantage is that we can use it to run code on the server. Compared to other languages used server-side like PHP or Ruby, Node runs I/O operations on a *single thread*, which means its less prone to slowing down the system. It's also *event-driven*, which means that it registers any incoming I/O operations as a callback and waits to finish its current process.

    It can also be used as a scripting language.

## Pair Programming

Based on [Code Fellows article](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/).

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
    - Greater efficiency
    - Engaged collaboration
    - Learning from fellow students
    - Social skills
    - Job interview readiness
    - Work interview readiness

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
    At the moment, I would say that job interview readiness is the most beneficial for me. In my previous experiences, in coding interviews, they often want you to walk them through your thought process and why you've written certain code, so being able to articulate outloud the coding process is important to me.

3. How does pair programming work?
    In pair programming, there are two roles. There's the Driver who is responsible for the typing and overall handling of code on the computer. The Navigator is responsible for thinking about the structure of code and providing input to the Driver, but they do not do any typing.
