## That Time When Woman Stopped Coding

Based on [this article](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding).

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

    More people started to have personal computers in their homes around the same time. Personal computers were treated like toys around that time, and like other toys, the target demographic had to be chosen, which ended up as men/boys.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

    It matters that males had been playing on computers growing up because as they became more ubiquitous, computer science programs began to make more assumptions about their students. This meant that someone that was a complete beginner (i.e. a woman who didn't grow up with computers) were treated as if they were behind on their knowledge.

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

    Diversity efforts are most successful when the leaders of companies themselves are invested in the cause.

2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

    Diverse companies perform better because they have plenty of input from different groups of people, allowing them to be more conscious of possible problems and also solutions.

3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

    A diverse company can serve a diverse user base in various ways. One particular idea that comes to mind is accessibility, and how having representation for people who have different needs internally can help us take preemptive action to include accessible features like a voice over, or options to adjust the display.
