## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

Based on this [New York Times article](https://archive.ph/QHhUe).

In this article, they discuss how Google had taken on a project called Project Aristotle to examine its teams to better understand why certain teams succeeded and others failed. They measured a variety of variables inclduing whether teams needed to be made up of people with similar interests, have similar educational backgrounds, out-going or shy personalities or motivated by the same type of rewards.

After discovering that none of these variables seemed to lead them to a concrete answer, they discovered that teams needed psychological safety. Everybody on a team needs to feel comfortable being able to communicate freely without judgment or they risk having ill-functioning social norms.

This rings true for me in a number of situations in my life, where I've noticed that people need to feel comfortable being themselves in all environments. I've witnessed this in my previous job, where many of my other colleagues refrained from asking a lot of questions to our managers as the social norm was to do what was asked. I've also witnessed this in the street dance community, where there is a social norm for people to respect each other regardless of experience.

## How I explained REST to my brother

Based on this [article](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550).

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

    Roy Fielding is the person responsible for helping write the HTTP protocol used to send and get pages from servers.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

    The techniques we use today don't work well to talk to all the machines in the world because they were not designed to be used in that way. Originally, it was a concern to be able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

    The HTTP protocol is a mechanism that works by applying verbs to nouns. More specifically, it can apply certain actions like GET or POST using URLs to manage data on computers all around the world.

4. What does a GET do?

    GET will retrieve any resource using a URL.

5. What does a POST do?

    POST will add any resource to another system.

6. What does PUT do?

    PUT will replace a piece of data in another system.

7. What does PATCH do?

    PATCH will do a partial update of a piece of data in another system.

## API Keys

    2. Weather Bit API -- yes

## Things I want to know more about

In terms of how to build a perfect team, It'd be interesting to learn more about how to organically create psychological safety.

In terms of REST, I want to learn more about the other types of repreentations of data that exist now aside from human-readable webpages and API data.
